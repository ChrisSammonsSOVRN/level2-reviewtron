Your implementation looks solid and well-organized. Here's a quick summary of what you have so far:

- **Manifest & Structure:**  
  Your manifest.json correctly registers the background service worker, content scripts, and popup UI (window.html), with the appropriate permissions and host access defined (see citeturn2file0).

- **Content Extraction & Messaging:**  
  The content script (content.js) is properly set up to extract text from web pages and forward it to the background script, which logs the information (see citeturn2file9 and citeturn2file5).

- **API Communication:**  
  Your extension-api.js is set to call your Node.js backend via a POST request. This module will fetch audit results based on the current tab URL (see citeturn2file6).

- **UI & Popup:**  
  The popup UI defined in window.html, styled with styles.css, loads window.js as a module. The window.js script retrieves the active tab URL, calls your backend API, and displays the results, which is a clean and effective approach (see citeturn2file3, citeturn2file4, and citeturn2file8).

- **Logging:**  
  Your logger.js module is in place to help with performance tracking and debugging (see citeturn2file7).

### Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing:**  
   - **Verify API Connectivity:** Test the full flow from the popup UI to the Node.js backend. Make sure the API call in extension-api.js correctly reaches your backend and returns the expected audit result. You can use browser developer tools (Network tab) and check server logs.
   - **End-to-End Verification:** Use the extension in your browser (load it via developer mode) to ensure that the content script, background script, and popup UI work seamlessly together.

2. **Error Handling & Enhancements:**  
   - Enhance error handling in the API module and UI so that users get clear feedback if something goes wrong.
   - Optionally, integrate the logger into other parts of your extension to capture more detailed performance metrics.

3. **Prepare for Advanced Features:**  
   - Once the extension integration is stable, you can move on to the next stage in your roadmap—setting up Puppeteer for automated site processing and advanced content checks. This step will add further functionality on the backend that your extension can eventually leverage.

Overall, your browser extension implementation is on the right track. The next immediate step is rigorous testing and integration with your backend, ensuring that all parts communicate correctly before moving on to more advanced features.
